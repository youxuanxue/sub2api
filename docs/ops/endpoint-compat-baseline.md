# TokenKey Endpoint Compatibility Baseline

This file is the curated endpoint-compatibility memory for TokenKey probes. It
is not a raw log archive and it is not a public product promise. Keep only
stable probe conclusions, evidence pointers, and the next probe focus.

## Update Rules

- Update this file after a release audit, endpoint-routing fix, media probe, or
  direct-vs-universal parity investigation.
- Do not paste full response bodies or secrets. Keep raw logs in `/tmp`, CI
  artifacts, or an incident bundle, and record only their paths or URLs.
- Record `unknown`, `SKIP`, and `FAIL` rows because they drive the next focused
  probe. Do not re-run the whole matrix when a focused row is enough.
- Treat `route_open_unservable` as a route-gate result, not live upstream
  support. Confirm live support with a universal matrix or account-model probe.
- Accepted parity target: for the same model name and protocol, a universal key
  should match a direct key bound to the same entitled group when that group has
  a schedulable account pool. Empty direct pools are recorded as
  `route_open_unservable` / `SKIP`, not as product defects.

### Evidence Pointers

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| `/tmp/tokenkey-direct-route-gate-1.8.76-20260703-134217.log` | no `config_error`; all probed route gates open or WS prelude returns `426` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-universal-skip-paid-1.8.76-20260703-134335.log` | `PASS=11 SKIP=7 FAIL=0`; Gemini text and OpenAI embeddings hit transient `429` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-universal-skip-paid-retry-1.8.76-20260703-134536.log` | `PASS=12 SKIP=6 FAIL=0`; Gemini text recovered, OpenAI embeddings still transient `429` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-universal-paid-media-embedding-1.8.76-20260703-141410.log` | `PASS=14 SKIP=4 FAIL=0`; paid media rerun: Gemini image and newapi image/video passed; OpenAI image unauthorized for this universal key; Gemini video not provisioned; OpenAI embeddings still `429` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-universal-embedding-retry-1.8.76-20260703-141551.log` | `PASS=12 SKIP=6 FAIL=0`; non-paid retry recovered Gemini text; OpenAI embeddings still `429` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-ssot-model-matrix-list-1.8.76-20260703-142404.tsv` | SSOT-derived live `/pricing` model/protocol matrix generated; excluded rows are explicit vendor/platform mapping gaps |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-ssot-model-matrix-smoke-1.8.76-20260703-142516.log` | SSOT matrix smoke run completed with no `FAIL`; surfaced current non-provisioned Anthropic catalog rows as `SKIP` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-ssot-model-matrix-nonpaid-1.8.76-20260703-143955.log` | SSOT-derived non-paid matrix run: most rows passed or were classified as model/protocol not provisioned; initial `FAIL` rows were isolated for focused rerun |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-ssot-focused-grok-messages-1.8.76-20260703-150238.log` | Focused rerun: Grok non-default `/v1/messages` rows are model/protocol-not-provisioned `SKIP`, not gateway schema `FAIL` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-ssot-focused-newapi-responses-1.8.76-20260703-150240.log` | Focused rerun: selected newapi `/v1/responses` rows are model/protocol-not-provisioned `SKIP`, not gateway schema `FAIL` |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-ssot-focused-newapi-chat-1.8.76-20260703-150241.log` | Focused rerun: GLM and Qwen preview chat rows pass when probed with required stream / thinking request shape |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-probe-cleanup-dryrun-1.8.76-20260703-134455.log` | active probe groups/keys remain `0/0`; no apply needed |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-universal-paid-media-20260703-112145.log` | previous paid-media baseline retained for trend comparison |
| `/tmp/tokenkey-account-model-probe-cleanup-20260703-113537.log` | previous account-model sanity: account 63 served `gpt-5.1`; cleanup left active probe resources at `0/0` |

## Compatibility Matrix

| anthropic | `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | open | route_open_unservable: empty direct probe pool returned `429` | supported | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | Count-tokens universal path is covered; direct live support needs a schedulable direct pool. |
| openai | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | open | supported | supported for text and responses | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | No full-matrix rerun needed unless OpenAI gateway routing changes. |
| openai | image `gpt-image-1` | unknown | unknown | not_authorized for the current universal key: `403 universal_no_entitled_group` | paid-media post-1.8.76 log | Reprobe with a universal key entitled to the OpenAI image group before claiming universal image parity. |
| openai | embeddings `text-embedding-3-small` | unknown | unknown | unknown: repeated SKIP `429` upstream throttle | universal logs; embedding retry log | Not a gateway regression, but embedding parity remains unproven until a non-throttled row passes. |
| gemini | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | open | route_open_unservable: empty direct probe pool returned `429` | supported | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | First universal run hit transient `429`; retry passed. |
| gemini | image `imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001` | unknown | unknown | supported | paid-media post-1.8.76 log | Direct live parity still needs a schedulable direct pool. |
| gemini | video `veo-3.1-generate-001` | unknown | unknown | route_open_unservable: model/account not provisioned on current pool | paid-media post-1.8.76 log | Reprobe only after Gemini video account/model provisioning changes. |
| antigravity | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | open | supported | supported for text | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | Keep direct-vs-universal parity watch when Gemini `/v1beta` routing changes. |
| newapi | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | open | supported | supported for text | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | Reprobe after newapi channel mapping or compatibility-pool changes. |

| kiro | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | open | route_open_unservable: empty direct probe pool returned `429` | supported for text | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | If direct Kiro serving is claimed, run account-model probe against the target account/model. |
| grok | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | open | supported | supported for text | direct route-gate log; universal retry log | No full-matrix rerun needed unless Grok model default or relay changes. |
| all platforms with `/v1/responses` GET prelude | WebSocket prelude | open: `426` upgrade required | unknown | unknown | direct route-gate log | Treat `426` as expected route-open prelude, not a failure. |
| public `/pricing` SSOT projection | all derived non-paid model/protocol rows | n/a | n/a | no remaining gateway schema `FAIL` after focused rerun; many rows are correctly `SKIP` because that model/protocol is not provisioned | SSOT matrix list, full non-paid run, focused rerun logs | Use this as the full-matrix source; do not hand-maintain a second all-model list. Paid full-matrix execution still requires explicit `--include-paid`. |

## Next Probe Focus

1. OpenAI embeddings returned `429` in every post-1.8.76 universal run. Retry
   with a non-throttled OpenAI embedding pool before marking embeddings
   supported.
2. OpenAI image returned `403 universal_no_entitled_group` for the current
   universal key. Reprobe with a key entitled to an OpenAI image-capable group.
3. Gemini video remains model/account-not-provisioned on the current pool; retry
   only after provisioning changes.
4. Some displayed/priced model-protocol combinations are intentionally not
   provisioned today: Grok non-default `/v1/messages`, selected newapi
   `/v1/responses`, and catalog-prep/upstream-unavailable models surface as
   `SKIP`. These are not gateway schema failures, but they are the concrete
   blockers to the stronger "all models all protocols" product promise.
5. The SSOT matrix currently excludes public-pricing rows whose vendors do not
   map to a universal platform/endpoint candidate. Decide whether those rows
   should become real universal surfaces or be removed/hidden from the relevant
   catalog surface.
6. Reprobe Anthropic/Gemini/Kiro direct live rows only when a real schedulable
   direct probe pool exists; current `429` rows prove route openness, not
   servability.
7. After every direct/account probe, run probe-resource cleanup dry-run. Apply
   cleanup if active `__tk_probe_*` groups or keys are nonzero. The 1.8.76
   dry-run showed active probe groups/keys remain `0/0`.
